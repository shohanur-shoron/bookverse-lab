I like to read religious books mostly Islamic religious books. The history of Islam and how they lived in that time etc. I also like to know how Islam spread around the world.

I enjoy reading biographies and memoirs that provide insights into the lives of influential figures. Learning about their struggles, achievements, and the impact they left on the world fascinates me. Their journeys inspire me to understand different perspectives and historical events.

I read primarily non-fiction to learn new skills or understand the world better. I'm interested in books on psychology, behavioral economics, or productivity hacks. I appreciate practical advice, well-researched information, and clear, actionable takeaways.

I'm looking for books that transport me to another time and place. I love historical fiction, especially set in Victorian England or Ancient Rome. I enjoy rich descriptions of the setting, the social customs, and the atmosphere of the era. It's less about grand events and more about soaking in the daily life and mood.

I need books that grab me from the first page and don't let go. I love fast-paced thrillers and psychological suspense novels. Twists and turns that keep me guessing are essential. I enjoy unreliable narrators and stories that explore the darker aspects of human psychology.
